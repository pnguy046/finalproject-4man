I'm using python 3 so that might affect you guys.

To use this, just use python twitter_streaming.py > [name of file you want to put the results in]

Currently using a bounding box around Riverside, CA including a little bit of Jurupa Valley and Moreno Valley.

Need to verify that these tweets are actually coming from our area. Gets returned in bounding box polygon coordinates. 

I ran it for the whole night (~10 hours) and it only came back with 13 MB of tweets. So either my coordinates are off, or we're going to need to run this for a long time to get 1 GB worth of data.
