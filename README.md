# To run (EASY): 
Start Elasticsearch. (Whatever version you have)

Navigate to this directory (the one this README is in)

Run the 
```
elasticquery.sh
```
script. This will bulk load all 35087 tweets into Elasticsearch.

To run a query, run the 
```
elasticquery.sh
```
script. This will search for your query term in tweet text.


# To run (MANUALLY):
If you want to manually run the commands, instead of using the scripts:

To use:
Navigate to the elasticsearch folder. Run this command: 
```
./elasticsearch-5.1.1/bin/elasticsearch 
```

(or whatever version of elasticsearch you're using) to start Elasticsearch.

To verify that Elasticsearch is running, open another terminal and use:
```
curl.exe -XGET http://localhost:9200
```
(Elasticsearch uses localhost:9200 by default) 

If it is running, navigate to the Elasticsearch folder once more in the second terminal, and run:
```
curl.exe -XPOST 'http://localhost:9200/_bulk' --data-binary '@<filename>'
```
Replace <filename>.
The file has to be a modified version of the tweets json, which creates an index called "tweetindex", with objects "tweet".

It should echo the tweets that were added to the index.

Then a sample query looks like this:
```
curl.exe -XGET 'localhost:9200/tweetindex/tweet/1?pretty'
```
this returns the first tweet in the index.

```
curl.exe -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/tweetindex/tweet/_search?q=Riverside&pretty'
```
this returns all tweets that contain the string "Riverside" in any of the fields.

NOTE: all these commands are for Windows Powershell. MacOS Terminal and unix terminals may use different commands. Ex. curl.exe would just be curl.
